## Technical Architecture

### Core Components Integration

```python
# Complete workflow orchestration
dev_lifecycle = Chain(
    # Phase 2: Issue Management
    parse_conversation,
    generate_github_issue,
    create_standardized_branch,
    
    # Human development work happens here
    detect_development_completion,
    
    # Phase 1: Commit Automation
    analyze_code_changes,
    extract_task_context,
    generate_commit_message,
    create_commit,
    
    # Existing: Release Automation
    analyze_release_readiness,
    generate_release_content,
    create_release,
    
    # Phase 3: Documentation Updates
    analyze_documentation_impact,
    update_living_documentation,
    validate_documentation_completeness
)
```

### Context Flow Design

```python
class WorkflowContext:
    """Maintains context across entire development lifecycle."""
    
    # Conversation â†’ Issue
    conversation_id: str
    extracted_tasks: List[Task]
    github_issue: GitHubIssue
    
    # Issue â†’ Branch  
    branch_name: str
    branch_context: BranchContext
    
    # Development â†’ Commit
    code_changes: CodeChanges
    commit_analysis: CommitAnalysis
    generated_commit: CommitMessage
    
    # Release Management
    release_analysis: ReleaseAnalysis
    release_content: ReleaseContent
    
    # Documentation Updates
    documentation_impact: DocumentationImpact
    updated_docs: List[DocumentationFile]
```
